#' Gene expression data from Alon et al. (1999)
#'
#' Gene expression levels from 40 tumor and 22 normal colon tissue samples. A
#' total of 6500 human genes were measured using an Affymetrix oligonucleotide
#' array. This dataset contains the 2000 genes with highest minimal intensity
#' across all samples. Note that the names of the genes have been omitted.

#' Cheddar cheese taste
#'
#' This dataset contains concentrations of various chemicals in 30 samples of
#' mature cheddar cheese, and a subjective measure of taste for each sample. The
#' variables `"Acetic"` and `"H2S"` are the natural logarithm of the
#' concentration of acetic acid and hydrogen sulfide respectively. The variable
#' `"Lactic"`, the concentration of lactic acid, has not been transformed.
#'
#' @format A `data.frame` with 30 rows and 5 variables:
#' \describe{
#'   \item{Case}{Sample number}
#'   \item{Taste}{Subjective taste test score, obtained by combining the scores of several tasters}
#'   \item{Acetic}{Natural log of concentration of acetic acid}
#'   \item{H2S}{Natural log of concentration of hydrogen sulfide}
