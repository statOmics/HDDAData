\title{Kidney transplant gene expression data from Einecke et al. (2010)}
\format{
A \code{data.frame} with patients (250) as rows and 10.001 features as columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{Reject_Status}: Binary variable indicating whether the transplanted
kidney was rejected (\code{1}) or not (\code{0}).
\item Remaining: gene expression levels for 10.000 genes. These were randomly
selected from the 25\% most variable genes in the original data
}

\description{
Gene expression data from patients receiving kidney transplantation, measured
using microarrays. The original data consists of 54675 genes from 282
patients. This data set contains a random subset of 250 patients and 10.000
of the 25\% most variable genes. For each patient, the rejection status of the
kidney transplant is recorded as well as the expression levels of each gene.
